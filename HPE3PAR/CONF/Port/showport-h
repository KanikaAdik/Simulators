SYNTAX
    showport [options] [-failed] [-sortcol <col>[,<dir>]] [<node:slot:port> |<pattern>...]

DESCRIPTION
    The showport command displays information about ports in the system.

AUTHORITY
    Any role in the system

OPTIONS
    -i
        Shows port hardware inventory information.

    -c
        Displays all devices connected to the port. Such devices include cages
        (for initiator ports), hosts (for target ports) and ports from other
        storage system (for RCFC and peer ports).

    -par
        Displays a parameter listing such as the configured data rate of a port
        and the maximum data rate that the card supports. Also shown is the
        type of attachment (Direct Connect or Fabric Attached) and whether the
        unique_nwwn and VCN capabilities are enabled.

    -rc
        Displays information that is specific to the Remote Copy ports.

    -rcfc
        Displays information that is specific to the Fibre Channel Remote Copy
        ports.

    -peer
        Displays information that is specific to the Fibre Channel ports for
        Data Migration.

    -rcip
        Displays information specific to the Ethernet Remote Copy ports.

    -iscsi
        Displays information about iSCSI ports.

    -iscsiname
        Displays iSCSI names associated with iSCSI ports.

    -fcoe
        Displays information that is specific to Fibre Channel over Ethernet
        (FCoE) ports.

    -sfp
        Displays information about the SFPs attached to ports.

    -ddm
        Displays Digital Diagnostics Monitoring (DDM) readings from the SFPs if
        they support DDM. This option must be used with the -sfp option.

    -d
        Displays detailed information about the SFPs attached to ports. This
        option is used with the -sfp option.

    -failed
        Shows only failed ports.

    -state
        Displays the detailed state information. This is the same as -s.

    -s
        Displays the detailed state information.
        This option is deprecated and will be removed in a subsequent release.

    -ids
        Displays the identities hosted by each physical port.

    -fs
        Displays information specific to the Ethernet File Persona ports.
        To see IP address, netmask and gateway information on File Persona,
        run "showfs -net".

    -sortcol <col>[,<dir>][:<col>[,<dir>]...]
        Sorts command output based on column number (<col>). Columns are
        numbered from left to right, beginning with 0. At least one column must
        be specified. In addition, the direction of sorting (<dir>) can be
        specified as follows:
          inc
              Sort in increasing order (default).
          dec
              Sort in decreasing order.

        Multiple columns can be specified and separated by a colon (:). Rows
        with the same information in them as earlier columns will be sorted
        by values in later columns.

SPECIFIERS
    <node:slot:port>...
        Requests that information for a specified port is displayed.
        This specifier can be repeated to display configuration information
        about multiple ports. If not specified, configuration information
        for all ports in the system is displayed.

        node
            Specifies the node using a number from 0 through 7.

        slot
            Specifies the PCI slot in the specified node. Valid ranges are:
            0 - 9 for the V-Class storage system platform.
            0 - 5 for the S- and T-Class storage system platforms.
            0 - 3 for the E200 storage system platform.
            0 - 2 for the F-Class storage system platform.

        port
            Specifies the port using a number from 1 through 4.

    <pattern>...
        Specifies that the port matching the specified glob-style
        pattern is displayed. This specifier can be repeated to display
        configuration information about multiple ports. If not
        specified, configuration information for all ports in the
        system is displayed.

NOTES
    None.
