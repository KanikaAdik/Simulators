col,showpd - Explanation of column headers for showpd

Id           Identifier of the physical disk.
CagePos      Position of the PD.  The format varies depending on the drive
             cage type:
               - DC1 format is <cage>:<side>.<mag>:<disk>, where <cage> is the
               cage number, <side> is 0 or 1 (for left or right, respectively,
               as viewed from the front), <mag> is the magazine number (0
               through 4) and <disk> is the disk position (0 through 3) within
               the magazine.
               - DC2 and DC4 format is <cage>:<mag>:<disk>, where <cage> is
               the cage number, <mag> is the magazine number (0 through 9) and
               <disk> is the disk position (0 through 3) within the magazine.
               - DC3 format is <cage>:<mag>:<disk>, where <cage> is the cage
               number, <mag> is the magazine number (0 through 15) and <disk>
               is always 0.
             If the position ends with "?" the current position of
             the drive is not known (for example, the drive may be missing),
             and the position shown is the last known position.
Size_MB      Total size of the disk in MB (1024^2 bytes).
Free_MB      Free size of the disk in MB (1024^2 bytes).
             This includes the size that is available to use, uninitialized,
             and unavailable to use.
Volume_MB    PD space used for volumes in MB (1024^2 bytes).
Spare_MB     PD space reserved for spares in MB (1024^2 bytes).
Unavail_MB   Unavailable PD space MB (1024^2 bytes).
Failed_MB    PD space in failed chunklets in MB (1024^2 bytes).
Total_Chunk  Number of chunklets on the PD.
Free_Chunk   Number of free chunklets on the PD.
Spare_Chunk  Number of spare chunklets on the PD.

             Counts of various types of chunklets on the PD.  The column
             names consist of three parts.
             The first part is either
                 Nrm      The chunklet is for normal use.
                 Spr      The chunklet is reserved for spare.
             The middle part is either
                 Used     The chunklet is used.
                 Unused   The chunklet is unused.
             The last part is one of
                 OK       The chunklet is OK.
                 Uninit   The chunklet is OK but uninitialized.
                 Unavail  The chunklet is unavailable.
                 Fail     The chunklet has failed.
Node_WWN     Node World Wide Name of the PD.
State        State of the PD, can be one of the following
                 normal   PD is normal
                 degraded PD is not operating normally. Use "showpd -state" to

Port_A0
Port_B0
Port_A1
Port_B1      Port location for the A and B ports of the PD, in the format
             <node>:<slot>:<port>.  Note that the primary path to the disk is
             shown by an asterisk(*) in either the A(APort) or B(BPort) column,
             and a minus(-) sign following a path indicates the port is
             disabled.
Path_A0
Path_B0
Path_A1
Path_B1      Similar to port information above but also shows the port
             information that is saved in the Table of Contents (TOC) if
             different from the current port.  If shown, the port saved in the
             TOC is shown after a '\'.
             Instead of an asterisk to show primary path information, the path
             selection order is shown in the Order column.
Capacity     The vendor's advertised disk drive capacity in GB.
Order        The order of preference of the path to the disk.
LdA          LD allocation allowed from this LD, Y = yes, N = no
Type         Device type of the PD.
                 FC    Fibre Channel PDs.
                 NL    Nearline PDs.
                 SSD   Solid State Drive PDs.
RPM          Drive relative performance metric. The number does not represent
             a rotational speed for the drives without spinning media (SSD). It
             is meant as a rough estimation of the performance difference
             between the drive and the other drives in the system. For FC and
             NL drives, the number corresponds to both a performance measure
             and actual rotational speed. For SSD drives, the number is to be
             treated as a relative performance benchmark that takes into
             account I/O's per second, bandwidth and access time.
MFR          Disk Drive Manufacturer.
Model        Manufacturer's device Id for disk.
Serial       Disk Drive serial number.
FW_Rev       Firmware Revision.
FW_Status    Firmware status.
Rd_CErr      Correctable read errors.
Rd_UErr      Uncorrectable read errors.
Wr_CErr      Correctable write errors.
Wr_UErr      Uncorrectable write errors.
Temp_DegC    Drive temperature (centigrade).
LifeLeft_PCT Percentage of wear leveling space remaining for the disk.
MediaType    Type of media the drive uses.
Protocol     Protocol type used by the drive.
SedState      Information about the encryption capabilities of the drive.
                 unknown          The SED capability is not known.
                 not_capable      The drive is not self-encrypting.
                 capable          The drive is a self-encrypting drive.
                 fips_capable     The drive is a FIPS compliant self-encrypting drive.
                 owned            The drive is a self-encrypting drive owned by
                                  this system.
                 fips_owned       The drive is a FIPS compliant self-encrypting
                                  drive and is owned by this system.
                 owned_by_other_system
                                  The drive is a self-encrypting drive, and is
                                  already owned by another system.
AdmissionTime The time when the PD was admitted.
