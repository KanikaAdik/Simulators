showld - Show information about logical disks (LDs) in the system.

SYNTAX
    showld [options <arg>] [<LD_name> |<pattern>...]

DESCRIPTION
    The showld command displays configuration information about the system's
    logical disks.

AUTHORITY
    Any role in the system

OPTIONS
    -cpg <CPG_name|pattern>...
        Requests that only logical disks in common provisioning groups (CPGs)
        that match the specified CPG names or patterns be displayed. Multiple
        CPG names or patterns can be repeated using a comma-separated list (for
        example -cpg <CPG_name>,<CPG_name>...).

    -vv <VV_name|pattern>...
        Requests that only logical disks mapped to virtual volumes that match
        and of the specified names or patterns be displayed. Multiple volume
        names or patterns can be repeated using a comma-separated list (for
        example -vv <VV_name>,<VV_name>...).

    -domain <domainname|pattern>...
        Only shows logical disks that are in domains with names that match any
        of the names or specified patterns. Multiple domain names or patterns
        can be repeated using a comma separated list (for example -domain
        <domainname_name>,<domainname_name>...).

    -sortcol <col>[,<dir>][:<col>[,<dir>]...]
        Sorts command output based on column number (<col>). Columns are
        numbered from left to right, beginning with 0. At least one column must
        be specified. In addition, the direction of sorting (<dir>) can be
        specified as follows:
          inc
              Sort in increasing order (default).
          dec
              Sort in decreasing order.

        Multiple columns can be specified and separated by a colon (:). Rows
        with the same information in them as earlier columns will be sorted
        by values in later columns.

    -d
        Requests that more detailed layout information is displayed.

    -p
        Requests that policy information about the logical disk is displayed.

    -state
        Requests that the detailed state information is displayed.
        This is the same as -s.

    -s
        Requests that the detailed state information is displayed.
        This option is deprecated and will be removed in a subsequent release.

SPECIFIERS
    <LD_name>...
        Requests that information for a specified logical disk is displayed.
        This specifier can be repeated to display configuration information
        about multiple logical disks. If not specified, configuration
        information for all logical disks in the system is displayed.

    <pattern>...
        Specifies that the logical disk matching the specified glob-style
        pattern is displayed. This specifier can be repeated to display
        configuration information about multiple logical disks. If not
        specified, configuration information for all logical disks in the
        system is displayed.

NOTES
    For this command, KB=1024 bytes and MB=1048576 bytes.

    A Domain column may be included by using the setclienv command to
    set listdom to 1.  The listdom option is also set to 1 if the CLI was
    started with the -listdom option, or if the CLI was started with the
    TPDLISTDOM environment variable set. Please run "cli -h"  and
    "setclienv -h" for details of the environment variables.

RefCnt       Indicates how many active relocation operations are occurring
             for the logical disk (reference count).
Avail        Availability characteristics when LD was created.
             Availability determines from where space chunklets can be
             allocated when one of the LD's chunklets fails.
             Availability characteristics are one of
                 disk  chunklets in the same RAID set may reside on the
                       same disk.
                 port  chunklets in the same RAID set belong to disks on
                       different port pairs.
                 cage  chunklets in the same RAID set belong to disks on
                       different cages.
                 mag   chunklets in the same RAID set belong to disks on
                       different magazines.
                 ch    There will be no redundancy for the LD when the
                       chunklet fails. This is only valid for RAID-0 LDs
CAvail       Current availability characteristic, may be different
             from Avail if some chunklets have been moved.
Keep_Preserved Available data in this LD will be preserved in special LDs
             reserved for preserved data in the event that LD loses
             multiple disks.
Dev_Type     Device type of the LD.
             Device type is one of
                 FC    All the chunklets in this LD are from PDs of
                       'FC' device type.
                 NL    At least one chunklet in this LD is from a PD of
                       'NL' device type.
                 SSD   At least one chunklet in this LD is from a PD of
                       'SSD' device type.
RPM          Drive relative performance metric. The number does not represent
             a rotational speed for the drives without spinning media (SSD). It
             is meant as a rough estimation of the performance difference
             between the drive and the other drives in the system. For FC and
             NL drives, the number corresponds to both a performance measure
             and actual rotational speed. For SSD drives, the number is to be
             treated as a relative performance benchmark that takes into
             account I/O's per second, bandwidth and access time.
