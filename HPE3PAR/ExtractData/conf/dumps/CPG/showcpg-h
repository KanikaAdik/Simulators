showcpg - Show Common Provisioning Groups.

SYNTAX
    showcpg [options <arg>] [<CPG_name>...|<pattern>...]

DESCRIPTION
    The showcpg command displays common provisioning groups (CPGs) in the
    system.

AUTHORITY
    Any role in the system

OPTIONS
    The following options cannot be used together with other options except
    -sortcol, -hist and -domain:

    -d  Show the detail information of CPGs.

    -r
        Specifies that raw space used by the CPGs is displayed.

    -alert
        Indicates whether alerts are posted.

    -alerttime
        Show times when alerts were posted (when applicable).

    -sag
        Specifies that the snapshot administration space auto-growth parameters
        are displayed.

    -sdg
        Specifies that the snapshot data space auto-growth parameters are
        displayed.

    -space (-s)
        Show the space saving of CPGs.

    The following options can be used together with other options:
    -sortcol <col>[,<dir>][:<col>[,<dir>]...]
        Sorts command output based on column number (<col>). Columns are
        numbered from left to right, beginning with 0. At least one column must
        be specified. In addition, the direction of sorting (<dir>) can be
        specified as follows:
          inc
              Sort in increasing order (default).
          dec
              Sort in decreasing order.

        Multiple columns can be specified and separated by a colon (:). Rows
        with the same information in them as earlier columns will be sorted
        by values in later columns.

    -hist
        Specifies that current data from the CPG, as well as the CPG's history
        data is displayed.

    -domain <domain_name_or_pattern,...>
        Shows only CPGs that are in domains with names matching one or more of
        the <domain_name_or_pattern> argument. This option does not allow
        listing objects within a domain of which the user is not a member.
        Patterns are glob-style (shell-style) patterns (see help on sub,globpat).

    -aocfg <aocfg_name>
        Show only CPGs that are in the AOCFG <aocfg_name>.

SPECIFIERS
    [<CPG_name>...|<pattern>...]
        Specifies that Common Provisioning Groups matching either the specified
        common provisioning group name or those common provisioning groups
        matching the specified pattern are displayed. This specifier can be
        repeated to display information for multiple common provisioning groups.
        If not specified, all common provisioning groups in the system are
        displayed.

NOTES
    When using the createaldvv command, the size of the logical disk space
    created is the first integer multiple of the RAID set size that is large
    enough to accommodate the requested virtual volume size.

    For example, with the default RAID-5 layout with a set size of 768 MB, a
    requested virtual volume size of 8192 MB causes the creation of logical
    disks with a total size rounded up to an integer multiple of 768 that is
    8448 MB. The growth increment of CPGs is similarly rounded up because the
    growth is done by creating logical disks that must be created in units of
    the logical disk RAID set size.

    For this command, 1 MB = 1048576 bytes.

    A Domain column may be included by using the setclienv command to
    set listdom to 1.  The listdom option is also set to 1 if the CLI was
    started with the -listdom option, or if the CLI was started with the
    TPDLISTDOM environment variable set. Please run "cli -h"  and
    "setclienv -h" for details of the environment variables.


EXAMPLES
    The following example displays a system's common provisioning groups:

        cli% showcpg

    The following example displays the historical data for the common
    provisioning groups:
        cli% showcpg -hist
